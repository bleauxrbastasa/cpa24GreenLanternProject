Team Green Lantern,
Proposal for "ComplianceChecker: A Java-Based Simulation Inspired by 'Papers, Please'"
Abstract
The proposed Java program, tentatively named "ComplianceChecker," aims to offer a simulated environment that models the core gameplay mechanics of the game "Papers, Please." The project aligns with the learning objectives in the college's learning plan for LAB Java class, specifically targeting the understanding and application of various data structures and algorithms. The purpose of the project is twofold: (1) To instill a deeper understanding of the concepts taught in the course, and (2) To familiarize students with practical implementation scenarios that make use of multiple data structures and algorithms.

Key Features
Dynamic Queue Management:
The program will utilize a queue data structure to manage the profiles presented to the player. This aligns with the learning activities of LO2, LO3, and LO4, which cover stack and queue operations. The system will dequeue profiles for the player to review and enqueue new ones dynamically, demonstrating real-time queue operations.

Profile & Requirement Repositories Using Trees:
To store profiles and compliance requirements, the program will employ tree data structures such as Binary Search Trees (BST) and AVL trees, in line with the coverage in LO5. The use of trees will facilitate efficient searching and retrieval of profiles and requirements, further educating students on their practical use-cases.

Algorithmic Complexity Analysis:
Students will be tasked to analyze the complexity of the algorithms used in the project, thereby aligning with LO6 objectives related to basic algorithm analysis and complexity. This involves a deep dive into the sorting and searching algorithms implemented in the program to ensure optimal performance.
